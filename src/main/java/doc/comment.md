Yes, that's a good approach. Restricting the **create**, update, and delete operations for the product table to 
users with the admin role is a standard security measure, ensuring only authorized personnel (e.g., admins) 
can manage product details.

Hereâ€™s how the access should be structured:

Access Control for Product Table:
Admin Role:

Create: Only admins can add new products.
Update: Only admins can modify existing product information, including prices, descriptions, or media.
Delete: Only admins have the authority to delete products from the system.
Regular Users:

Read (Select): Regular users can view products, search for them, or filter them based on categories and 
other criteria. They have no permissions to modify, create, or delete products.
By implementing this structure, you protect the integrity of the product information and ensure that only 
authorized users can perform sensitive operations on the product data. This is a best practice for maintaining 
security and control in the system.


**Here's a summary of the tables and their access permissions:**

**Admin Access Tables (for creating, updating, and deleting)**
Products Table: Admins can manage product listings.
Product Media Table: Admins can add media (images, videos) for products.
Product Specifications Table: Admins can enter detailed specifications for products.
Product Policies Table: Admins can manage warranty and return policies.
Special Offers Table: Admins can add and manage special offers for products.
Product Tags Table: Admins can manage tags for products.

**Customer Access Tables (for creating and updating)**
Product Reviews Table: Customers can submit reviews and ratings for products.
Product Comments Table: Customers can add comments related to products.
Summary
Admin: Full access to product management tables.
Customers: Can interact with reviews and comments but cannot modify product listings or associated 
media/specifications/policies.t Tags: Used for search, but not directly managed by customers.




**Note**

Exactly! In this architecture, you can structure the interactions as follows:

Customer Interactions
Creating Products:

Action: Customers (or admins) can create products through the Product Service.
Endpoint: Typically, this would be a POST request to an endpoint like /api/products.
Result: This action triggers an event (e.g., ProductCreated) that gets published to Kafka.
Fetching Products:

Action: Customers can search for products through the Search Service.
Endpoint: This could be a GET request to an endpoint like /api/search/products.
Process:
The Search Service listens for events from the Product Service (e.g., product creation, updates, or deletions).
Upon receiving an event, the Search Service updates its own database to reflect the changes.
When a customer performs a search, the Search Service queries its optimized data store (e.g., product_search_index) to return relevant products.
Summary of Interactions
Create (Product Service):

Customers/admins create new products.
The product information is stored in the Product Service's database.
An event is published to Kafka.
Fetch (Search Service):

Customers search for products.
The Search Service queries its database, which has been updated based on events from the Product Service.
Customers receive search results that are quick and relevant.
Advantages of This Setup
Decoupling: The product creation and search functionalities are decoupled, allowing for independent scaling and maintenance.
Optimized Search: The Search Service can be optimized for querying and performance without being tied to the product management logic.
Real-Time Updates: Using an event-driven approach ensures that the Search Service's data is kept up-to-date with the latest product information.
Overall, this architecture allows for flexible and efficient interactions while adhering to microservices principles.
